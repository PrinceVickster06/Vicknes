    <p><a href="Game of the Week.html">Dishonored 2 </a>is a classic example of the &ldquo;immersive sim&rdquo; — a genre  where detailed worldbuilding and consistent mechanics give players many paths  to every goal. In this case, the mechanics include swordfighting, guns and  crossbows, stealth, and an array of special abilities like stopping time and  shapeshifting. <br />
      It&rsquo;s set in a quasi-Victorian world called the Empire of the Isles,  ruled by the young empress Emily Kaldwin with the help of her father and  bodyguard Corvo Attano, protagonist of the first Dishonored.</p>
    <p>THE VOID ENGINE</p>
    <p>Dishonored  2 is beautifully brought to life with the new Void Engine, a leap forward in  rendering technology. Designed to support world-class art direction and take  full advantage of the powerful hardware this generation has to offer.  </p>
