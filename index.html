    <p><a href="Game of the Week.html">Dishonored 2 </a>is a classic example of the &ldquo;immersive sim&rdquo; — a genre  where detailed worldbuilding and consistent mechanics give players many paths  to every goal. In this case, the mechanics include swordfighting, guns and  crossbows, stealth, and an array of special abilities like stopping time and  shapeshifting. <br />
      It&rsquo;s set in a quasi-Victorian world called the Empire of the Isles,  ruled by the young empress Emily Kaldwin with the help of her father and  bodyguard Corvo Attano, protagonist of the first Dishonored.</p>
    <p>THE VOID ENGINE</p>
    <p>Dishonored  2 is beautifully brought to life with the new Void Engine, a leap forward in  rendering technology. Designed to support world-class art direction and take  full advantage of the powerful hardware this generation has to offer.  </p>

    <h1>Computer Crazy: ‘Crazy’ by name, ‘crazy’ by nature!</h1>
    <p><br />
    A local business, ‘‘Computer Crazy’’, selling computer (PC) games and specialisedgaming PC equipment, wants to expand its business across the UK. Currently they have 5 shops in the Middlesex/North London area but no website.</p>
    <p><br />
      They specialise in selling computer games (EG games that run on PCs and Macs) and in particular the less well known PC games which some of the main retailers don’t stock. They also build and sell specialised gaming PCs which are either made to order or from some standard models they manufacture. They have a loyal following of customers who travel from across the UK to buy games from their shops.</p>
    <p>Sunil and Tom started ‘Computer Crazy’ 3 years ago in an attempt to have a ‘one stop’ shop where PC gaming enthusiasts like themselves could find more challenging games. They found it annoying that the ‘big’ game retailers only stocked the main streamgames when they knew there were hundreds if not thousands of less well known, but no less enjoyable, games out there in cyber space! So they opened a small shop near where they lived and started trawling the net for the less well known PC games and started playing and reviewing them. Those they liked they bought and stocked in the shop!</p>
    <p><br />
      They started to build PCs that were fit to play these games! Not the flash boxes with fantastic names (and fantastic prices) which did little more than light up like a Christmas tree. They wanted to build high performance PCs at reasonable prices which knocked the socks off the ones available from the big chains. So that’s what they did! And pretty soon the gaming community got to know about them.<br />
      Now they have five shops, a large warehouse holding thousands of PC game titles and PC components, and thousands of loyal customers. And now, with this new website you can join them whenever you are in the UK.<br />
