    <p><a href="Game of the Week.html">Dishonored 2 </a>is a classic example of the &ldquo;immersive sim&rdquo; â€” a genre  where detailed worldbuilding and consistent mechanics give players many paths  to every goal. In this case, the mechanics include swordfighting, guns and  crossbows, stealth, and an array of special abilities like stopping time and  shapeshifting. <br />
      It&rsquo;s set in a quasi-Victorian world called the Empire of the Isles,  ruled by the young empress Emily Kaldwin with the help of her father and  bodyguard Corvo Attano, protagonist of the first Dishonored.</p>
    <p>THE VOID ENGINE</p>
    <p>Dishonored  2 is beautifully brought to life with the new Void Engine, a leap forward in  rendering technology. Designed to support world-class art direction and take  full advantage of the powerful hardware this generation has to offer.  </p>

    <p><img src="../Images/2848570-uc4boxclean.jpg" width="150" height="168" alt="Uncharted 4" />Verdict: 10/10 Outstanding</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Set 3 years after the events of Uncharted 3, Nathan Drake has apparently left the world of fortune hunting behind. However, it doesn&rsquo;t take long for adventure to come calling when Drake&rsquo;s brother, Sam, re-emerges asking for his help to save his own life and offering an adventure Drake cannot resist. On the hunt for Captain Henry Avery&rsquo;s long-lost treasure, Sam and Drake embark on a journey to find Libertalia, the pirate utopia deep in the forests of Madagascar. Uncharted 4: A Thief&rsquo;s End takes players around the globe, through jungle isles, urban cities and snow-capped peaks on the search for Avery&rsquo;s fortune. [Naughty Dog]</p>
    <p><strong><em>Whats Good?</em></strong></p>
    <p>It is rip-roaring stuff. There is no great illusion here; any risk that may have been associated with Nathan Drake&rsquo;s introduction a decade ago has long gone, swept away in a tide of crowd-pleasing spectacle. But Uncharted 4&rsquo;s swagger makes it easy to succumb to the ride, its craftmanship, sense of adventure and willingness to open up to its players providing a potent sugar-rush of popcorn gaming pleasure.</p>
    <p> Uncharted 4 is a landmark title that anyone remotely interested in interactive storytelling should invest in. Naughty Dog has once again raised the bar across the industry. Thrilling shootouts, a staggering level of detail, breathtaking visuals and emotional depth come together to make Uncharted 4: A Thief's End a must-play masterpiece.</p>
    <p>Naughty Dog's victory lap is a celebration of its past, present and future, with clever pacing and thrilling set-pieces surpassing expectations in its most exhilarating Uncharted to date. No PS4 should be without this.</p>
    <p>With our video game reviews we reserve a five-star rating for games that we think everyone should experience, that are so interesting or impressive in certain areas that they transcend any flaws, limitations or genre concerns. Uncharted 4 is certainly in that category.</p>
