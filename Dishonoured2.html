    <p><a href="Game of the Week.html">Dishonored 2 </a>is a classic example of the &ldquo;immersive sim&rdquo; — a genre  where detailed worldbuilding and consistent mechanics give players many paths  to every goal. In this case, the mechanics include swordfighting, guns and  crossbows, stealth, and an array of special abilities like stopping time and  shapeshifting. <br />
      It&rsquo;s set in a quasi-Victorian world called the Empire of the Isles,  ruled by the young empress Emily Kaldwin with the help of her father and  bodyguard Corvo Attano, protagonist of the first Dishonored.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Dishonored 2 is a classic example of the &ldquo;immersive sim&rdquo; — a genre  where detailed worldbuilding and consistent mechanics give players many paths  to every goal.

    <p><strong><em>THE VOID ENGINE</em></strong></p>
    <p><strong><em>Dishonored  2 is beautifully brought to life with the new Void Engine, a leap forward in  rendering technology. Designed to support world-class art direction and take  full advantage of the powerful hardware this generation has to offer. </em></strong></p>
    <p><strong><em>Whats Good?</em></strong></p>
    <p>Betrayal, usurpers, a nasty frame job – familiar story beats make this The Force Awakens to Dishonored&rsquo;s A New Hope. But if you&rsquo;re concerned that this means Arkane&rsquo;s sequel is a bit conservative, don&rsquo;t be. Dishonored 2 is one of the best stealth-action games ever made. </p>
    <p>Much of what made the original game such a success has been thankfully retained, but at double the size. Emily and Corvo&rsquo;s new adventure has allowed the developers to lavish it with improvements and unexpected twists, leaving it as novel as it is dense. The first of these is the ability to not just play as a no longer mute Corvo, but Emily as well, and it&rsquo;s an incredibly welcome change. Stephen Russell (Garrett from Thief) and Erica Luttrell (Steven Universe&rsquo;s Sapphire) put in admirable performances as the duo, emphasising the game&rsquo;s personal stakes in a way the first did not.  </p>
    <p>What's Bad? </p>
    <p>There&rsquo;s no getting around it, so let&rsquo;s start with the bad: <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/3140452/software/dishonored-2s-buggy-pc-port-is-plagued-by-performance-problems.html"><em>Dishonored 2</em> is busted</a> on many, many PCs.</p>
    <p>That said, it's lightly less busted after installing the new 1.2 patch that released on Tuesday. But things still aren&rsquo;t <em>great</em> by any means. I&rsquo;m still seeing wild frame rate swings, from 100+ down to 50 on Ultra settings with a GeForce GTX 980 Ti at 1080p, depending on where I am and what I&rsquo;m looking at. Worse is that the settings still seem like window dressing. Frame rates stay almost exactly the same regardless of whether I&rsquo;m on Ultra or Very Low, and the game relies on console-style upscaling as a crutch.</p>
    <p>Improvements: </p>
    <p>They should next time add in the new features to make the game more interesting.</p>
    <p>Improve the optimisation to make sure that the screen to make it more reliable.</p>
    <p>The graphics has to imporve properly to make sure that the eyes of the user shouldn't contain any of the flashing photography. </p>
