    <p><a href="Game of the Week.html">Dishonored 2 </a>is a classic example of the &ldquo;immersive sim&rdquo; — a genre  where detailed worldbuilding and consistent mechanics give players many paths  to every goal. In this case, the mechanics include swordfighting, guns and  crossbows, stealth, and an array of special abilities like stopping time and  shapeshifting. <br />
      It&rsquo;s set in a quasi-Victorian world called the Empire of the Isles,  ruled by the young empress Emily Kaldwin with the help of her father and  bodyguard Corvo Attano, protagonist of the first Dishonored.</p>
    <p>THE VOID ENGINE</p>
    <p>Dishonored  2 is beautifully brought to life with the new Void Engine, a leap forward in  rendering technology. Designed to support world-class art direction and take  full advantage of the powerful hardware this generation has to offer.  </p>

    <p><em><strong><img src="../Images/maxresdefault.jpg" width="150" height="168" alt="Titanfall 2" />Rating: 10/10 Outstanding</strong></em></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span itemprop="description">In single player, Titanfall 2 delivers a crafted experience that explores the unique bond between man and machine. Playable offline, the single player campaign in Titanfall 2 lets fans step out onto The Frontier as a Militia rifleman with aspirations of becoming an elite Pilot. Stranded behind enemy lines and facing overwhelming odds, players must team up with a veteran Titan to uphold a mission they were never meant to carry out. In multiplayer, Respawn is continuing to evolve their gameplay to provide a more robust experience that delivers expanded depth and variety that includes six new Titans, deeper Pilot abilities, more customization options, and a robust progression system that is sure to satisfy fans. </span></p>
    <p><strong><em>Whats Good?</em></strong></p>
    <p><em><strong>I</strong></em>mpressive, inventive solo campaign</p>
    <p> Superb combat and movement mechanics</p>
    <p> BT is an ET for the Modern Warfare generation</p>
    <p> Excellent multiplayer improves on the original</p>
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>While its contemporaries focus on new ways with which to shock and excite on screen, Respawn makes the simple act of playing feel superlative. Its multiplayer is bigger and better, with the necessary depth and momentum to take it beyond these first few months after release, while its short but exciting single-player mode has the craft of some of the best campaigns of the last decade.</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s a better, and fuller version of the original game to me, and ideally we&rsquo;ll see developer Respawn get another chance to expand upon the series in the near future. </p>

    <p>What's Bad? </p>
    <p>Some ideas shuffled away before their time</p>
    <p> Visuals are strong, but not the best you&rsquo;ll see this year    </p>
    <p>Improvements: </p>
    <p>They should next time add in the new features to make the game more interesting.</p>
    <p>Improve the optimisation to make sure that the screen to make it more reliable.</p>
    <p>The graphics has to imporve properly to make sure that the eyes of the user shouldn't contain any of the flashing photography. </p>
