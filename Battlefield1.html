    <p><a href="Game of the Week.html">Dishonored 2 </a>is a classic example of the &ldquo;immersive sim&rdquo; — a genre  where detailed worldbuilding and consistent mechanics give players many paths  to every goal. In this case, the mechanics include swordfighting, guns and  crossbows, stealth, and an array of special abilities like stopping time and  shapeshifting. <br />
      It&rsquo;s set in a quasi-Victorian world called the Empire of the Isles,  ruled by the young empress Emily Kaldwin with the help of her father and  bodyguard Corvo Attano, protagonist of the first Dishonored.</p>
    <p>THE VOID ENGINE</p>
    <p>Dishonored  2 is beautifully brought to life with the new Void Engine, a leap forward in  rendering technology. Designed to support world-class art direction and take  full advantage of the powerful hardware this generation has to offer.  </p>

    <p> <span itemprop="description">Intuitive destruction and dynamic weather ensure that no battle is ever the same. For even more gameplay possibilities, carve a path through walls and buildings, take down your enemies in creative ways, and leave your mark on the terrain around you through intuitive destruction. Through your actions, the pristine world around you change into a battle-scarred landscape, changing the world forever. With dynamic weather you will need to adapt your tactics to weather changes as the elements play a part in the battle. Playing the same map on a bright day, in heavy fog, or rain will impact what you see and hear, forcing you to adapt your play style on an ever-changing battlefield. Operations introduces a new way to play multiplayer. In Battlefield 1 you play a series of interconnected battles across multiple fronts. Play a sequence of battles where your actions have consequences beyond a single match, as you try to conquer territory or push back your attackers. At those times when you feel all is lost, call in the Behemoths - the largest fully player-controlled vehicles ever seen in Battlefield. Roam the battlefield and rain fire on your enemy to break their defenses. All-out war never felt so epic. Take control of the Armored Train, Air Ship, or the Battleship to dominate the battlefield across land, air, and sea. </span></p>
    <p><strong><em>Whats Good?</em></strong></p>
    <p>Battlefield is back in shape and more so with fresh theme of the first Great War! After a long time, the campaign is successful and multiplayer is traditionally excellent. So, this year your choice is set!</p>
    <p>Much of what made the original game such a success has been thankfully retained, but at double the size. Emily and Corvo&rsquo;s new adventure has allowed the developers to lavish it with improvements and unexpected twists, leaving it as novel as it is dense. The first of these is the ability to not just play as a no longer mute Corvo, but Emily as well, and it&rsquo;s an incredibly welcome change. Stephen Russell (Garrett from Thief) and Erica Luttrell (Steven Universe&rsquo;s Sapphire) put in admirable performances as the duo, emphasising the game&rsquo;s personal stakes in a way the first did not.  </p>
    <p>What's Bad? </p>
    <p>There&rsquo;s no getting around it, so let&rsquo;s start with the bad: <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/3140452/software/dishonored-2s-buggy-pc-port-is-plagued-by-performance-problems.html"><em>Dishonored 2</em> is busted</a> on many, many PCs.</p>
    <p>That said, it's lightly less busted after installing the new 1.2 patch that released on Tuesday. But things still aren&rsquo;t <em>great</em> by any means. I&rsquo;m still seeing wild frame rate swings, from 100+ down to 50 on Ultra settings with a GeForce GTX 980 Ti at 1080p, depending on where I am and what I&rsquo;m looking at. Worse is that the settings still seem like window dressing. Frame rates stay almost exactly the same regardless of whether I&rsquo;m on Ultra or Very Low, and the game relies on console-style upscaling as a crutch.</p>
    <p>Improvements: </p>
    <p>They should next time add in the new features to make the game more interesting.</p>
    <p>Improve the optimisation to make sure that the screen to make it more reliable.</p>
    <p>The graphics has to imporve properly to make sure that the eyes of the user shouldn't contain any of the flashing photography. </p>
